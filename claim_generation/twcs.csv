@116569 Our crew is there to serve you and not deceive you in any way. We're also here to help so please share your flight details via DMs.,,,,,,,
@AmericanAir 1st and foremost - your crew has been lying to us for over an hour. Then after being deceived by your crew for over an hour - we are being lied to again as they advised us the new plane we are transferring to is departing at 7:45pm - however they have not begun boarding yet.,,,,,,,
"@AmericanAir Not only has my family, and several other families been inconvenienced by @AmericanAir  today - this is now 16 flights in one year with only 5 ""on time"" departures.",,,,,,,
"@116569 Our offer still stands to assist, Andrew.",,,,,,,
@AmericanAir But - that's really not the issue. The issue is @AmericanAir habitually inconveniences its customer base and displays a demeanor that its a  normal practice in the airlines industry with no above and beyond accommodations offered to its inconvenienced and unsatisfied customers !,,,,,,,
@AmericanAir I have flown @AmericanAir 15 times in the past 12 months and only departed on schedule 4 times.,,,,,,,
@AmericanAir After 1 hour of being lied to by the pilot - we are now being totally inconvenienced by having to un-board this plane and board another plane - meanwhile i should be landing in Miami in 50 minutes. Completely irresponsible and utmost negligent on Pilots behalf,,,,,,,
@116569 We're sorry for the delay. The previous pilot may not have been aware of the problem. We appreciate your patience.,,,,,,,
"@AmericanAir stuck on flight 609 in Charlotte over 55 minutes due to a computer card tech issue while pilot repeatedly advised it would only take a ""few minutes"" to fix. Why wasn't this issue reported by previous pilot that arrived minutes b4 we boarded in effort to save time?",,,,,,,

@119526 If a buyer has a negative feedback for not paying it's not going to stop them from bidding on your item. If you set up buyer requirements correctly you can restrict them from bidding if they've had an unpaid item case: https://t.co/5GCQb0r3Is. ^BC,,,,,,,
"@AskeBay So maybe they‚Äôre restricted in the future, maybe not? And as a seller I have no idea how reliable a buyer is? Yea that‚Äôs a horrible setup.",,,,,,,
@119526 I appreciate it is frustrating but leaving a negative feedback won't stop them from doing it again. If you open an unpaid item case they will receive a strike for non payment which can lead to restrictions from bidding in future. ^BC,,,,,,,

@British_Airways Please...  no the corporate line. I booked two business class flights. In an emergency. I'm trying to cancel giving 2 months notice. #ba,,,,,,,
@British_Airways I flew with a different carrier that could get me to the detonation. I flew the next day!!! I didn't realise I had got the wrong dates. #ba,,,,,,,
"@British_Airways And @2042... I refuse to air my laundry in public, but if you knew WHY I was flying you'd get it. But that should not be the point",,,,,,,

@120655 Hi there. Really sorry to hear this. Which train are you on please? - Josh,,,,,,,
@GWRHelp I'd quite like to get a train from Burnham to Paddington and back again so I can be on time,,,,,,,
@120655 A service is due at 08.15 which is currently running on time - Josh,,,,,,,
@GWRHelp And two of the flipping windows won't shut properly so it's absolutely freezing. Just total rubbish,,,,,,,

"@GWRHelp @122145 @1768 GWR trains 10.31, 10.37 etc remember all these delays this week and poor service when you put prices up again @122145 what a mess!",,,,,,,
@122144 @122145 @1768 The delay was due to a late arrival of the previous service and waiting for a platform at Oxford. - Jordan,,,,,,,
"@GWRHelp @122145 @1768 Hmm the guard said it was due to a train fault. Nice to know you talk to each other...just get your act together, I missed my cinnection.",,,,,,,
@122144 @122145 @1768 The 10:31 service has been delayed due to a fault. The 10:37 due to platform issue because of the late arrival from the previous journey.,,,,,,,
"@GWRHelp @122145 @1768 Does it matter still bad service. Not worth the dates you charge best railway is a nationalised railway, people b4 your profit!",,,,,,,

@122608 Hate to hear you are having this issue.  If you are unable to get a message to go through while on Wi-Fi then that sounds like an issue with the Wi-Fi itself unless it happens on every Wi-Fi.  Is your imessages off?,,,,,,,
"@sprintcare It happens on every single wifi. I am a Sytems Administrator, IT professional, and I am certain that all these WiFi‚Äôs cant be misconfigured. I have tried imessage off, on, mms off and on, even reset network settings and updated carrier settings.",,,,,,,
"@122608 Well that sounds extremely frustrating, especially considering what you do.  Our steps we have are for when a customer can not send on our network.  However, have you tried backing up your phone, then resetting your phone through ITunes?",,,,,,,
"@sprintcare I have not yet. I am beginning a dialogue with Apple Support now, if that does not help I will try to reset the phone. If after that and still no progress, what options are available for me. I have already replaced the phone once before for hanging up and random shutdowns.",,,,,,,
@sprintcare I can DM you my info if you need to look at the account associated to see what options we have,,,,,,,
@122608 Ok let see what Apple comes up with to see if the phone need a reset the chat will be open. Just let us know the outcome with apple solution.,,,,,,,

"@VirginTrains Oh dear. Puts me off buying advance tickets. Seems rules made by those who never travel. Sorry to bombard you with Qs, thanks for replies.",,,,,,,
@122650 It's because they are the cheaper tickets sold to fill quieter services so there are more restrictions. ^PA,,,,,,,
